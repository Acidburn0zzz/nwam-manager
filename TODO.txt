List of things that still need to be done.
==========================================

General Tasks
-------------

  Security

    - Determine required privileges to be functional
      - Will need to wait until using NWAM APIs.


  Look & Feel

    - Icons need to be designed.
      - Lead time?
      - Easy to slot in?


  Documentation

    - Determine "Help" link points
    - Tool-tips, as appropriate.

Panel Icon
----------

  Events

    - Notifications
      - Code using Signals in the Daemon
      - Have nwam-manager listen for these signals
      - Consider Simulation Mechanism for Events (Temporary API)
        - Menu Selection of Network/Env could tell daemon to emit signal
        - Async events could be done using a timer or pipe?


  Tool-tip in Notification Area

    - Should reflect status information
      - Do we need to cache data?
   

  Encryption Icon

    - Consider something more meaningful like a key?


  Globe Icon

    - Is this the right symbol? Maybe is too confusing? Doesn't really suggest
      that it's any way related to the network.


  Menu Items (Done by Lin, no callbacks)

    - Add About Entry	(on_active_about)
    - Add Help Entry	(on_active_help)


  Session (Done by Lin, review?)

    - Auto restart on crash?
    - Save itself in the session.
    - Should be in default session.

Network Preferences
-------------------

  Network Environment Preferences Dialog

    - Rules Tab [partly done, need glue work]
      - Condition Combo 
        - <None> should deactivate other entries
        - All others should activate them
      - +/- buttons
      - Add API to Env to support add/delete and creation of rules.
	- currently add two signals (add/remove), so we can connect them
	  using common env_condition add/remove functions to do automatically
	- may add more signals such like modify a condition.
	- need more for initialize a env_condition.

    - Network Services Tab
      - Default Network Services        
        - Add API to Env to get state of Default services
        - May also need to add this to the Daemon for Env to get default set,
          if not configured in Env.
	  [lin] Daemon owns the default set, Env provide the locate function.
	  For each default set call locate in Env set, if there marks yes on
	  the tree view.
      - Additional Network Services     
        - Need a utility function to get list of known SMF services from the
          OS.
      - Add Button                      
        - Dialog to present list of FRMI (and description?).
        = Env API to add a new service.
      - Remove Button                   
        = Env API to delete a service.

    - Proxy Tab
      - Add Password Dialog

    - Help Button needs to be connected.


  VPN Dialog

    - Start/Stop buttons should toggle sensitivity depending on the currently
      selected ENM's state. [done, lin]
    - Help Button needs to be connected.


  Connection Status Panel

    - If an ENM is activated, the connection status need to be refreshed [done, lin]
      - It may be worth linking to the objects "notify" signal for each
        element in a view? [partly done, need filter signals. lin]
      - VPN label list [done, lin]
  

  Network Configuration Panel

    - Sorting/Re-ordering of NCUs should be reflected in the NCP.
      - Will require NCP's API to be updated.

    - Conditions
      - Update the Condition Label to contain the NCU name.
      - Handle the Toggle Button
      - Handle the Connected/Disconnected Combo
      - Implement NCU Conditions TreeView
      - Handle the Enable/Disabled Combo


  IP Sub Panel

    - General
      - Validation on values, should be deferred to the NCU object.

    - DHCP
      - Handle Renew Lease button
  
    - Multiple IP Address Tables - IPv4
      - IPv6 Toggle Buttons
      - Add/Remove Buttons
      - Handle in place edits for cells

    - Multiple IP Address Tables - IPv6
      - Handle Enabled/Disabled Combo
        - Should reflect state in the NCU
      - IPv6 Toggle Buttons
        - Should reflect state in the NCU
      - Add/Remove Buttons
      - Handle in place edits for cells


  Wireless Sub Panel

    - Handle Combo for "If no favourite..."
      - Is this a Daemon level preference rather than an NCU specific one?

    - Ask Before... 
      - Open/Close is leaving a gap - probably needs a fix in the glade file.
      - Handle Toggle buttons here 
        - should most likely be set in the Daemon since really they are not
          specific to the NCU. 
        - Maybe consider moving them?

Common API
----------

  General Tasks

    - Need to consider adding a "modified" / "dirty" flag and a "commit"
      function to each object to allow us to handle the "OK" button case and
      know that we will need to commit changes.


  Daemon 

    - Needs to be modified to emit signals for all the possible events that
      can be sent from the real daemon.


  Condition(s)

    - Create a conditions GObject for the NCU and Env conditions.
      - Might need to sub-class if there are differences...
   

  Env

    - Will need API for Conditions


  NCU

    - Will need API for Conditions


GNOME Netstatus Applet
----------------------

  Port Wireless support on Solaris.

    - Determine required priv to gather Wifi Info.
      - Right now, it's not even possible to open() the network device as
        non-root.
    - Implement the Solaris wifi gathering functions.


General Optional Areas of Rework
--------------------------------

  API

    - Instead of using GList from the common GObjects, consider using a
      GtkListStore - especially for things like IP addresses, Wifi Favourites,
      etc.
