	Change 'VPN Applications' to 'Network Modifiers' throughout. Bump
	to version 1.16.0.

	Indicate which functions are disabled if user only has
	Network Autoconf User rights profile.

	Add 'Switched profile' notification message, which is already
	implemented but wasn't in the UI spec.

	Bump to version 1.15.2.

	Remove intention that pressing Esc while typing in password
	field should restore the previous password, due to implementation
	difficulties. (Edit Wireless Network dialog). Instead, pressing
	Esc will just activate the Cancel button, reverting all changes
	made in the dialog while it was open.

	Add Network Profile button no longer opens Add Network Profile
	dialog, but just adds a new unnamed profile to the list, which
	can be renamed in-place, and subsequently edited by clicking
	the Edit Network Profile button. This behaviour isn't ideal, 
	but is due to a limitation of the underlying implementation, 
	and is at least consistent with the addition/renaming of ENMs 
	(aka VPN Applications) and Locations in the GUI.

	Modify nsswitch file selection behaviour, per  #12593.

	Show "Click here to change saved password" in disabled text field
	when showing Join Wireless Network dlg, per #12941.

2009-12-08 Calum Benson  <calum.benson@sun.com>

	* nwam-ui-spec.pages
	* nwam-ui-spec.pdf

	Add 'NCP is/isn't' rule for locations and ENMss, per #13141.

	Show signal strength as text rather than %ge, per #12994.

	'Add to favorites' checkbox should remember state between different
	parts of the GUI, per #12917.

	For clarity, change text style of portions of spec that are not 
	implemented in Phase 1.

	Bumped to v1.15, but not pushed to website yet-- still a couple
	of other issues to address first.

Remove functionality that won't make it into Phase 1: Network Services tab, ability to rename Locations and VPN Applications once committed to system, ability to rename NCUs, wireless security types other than WEP and WPA Personal, option to join an open network if no favorite networks available, and all "Ask Before" options on wireless tab. 

Minor tweaks: clicking panel icon should open Network Prefs rather than Location Prefs dialog, VPN Applications dialog should have a Rename button, and Connection Properties view now only shows manually enabled NCUs, plus NCUs in the active priority group.
